Subject: [PATCH] dts: Disable unhandled or broken IRQ monitoring

This is primarily intended for generic x86 kernels which may run on all
sorts of broken systems. Our kernel will run on a very specific hardware
configuration with known drivers and devices, which makes this
unnecessary.

Enable noirqdebug to avoid the minor overhead added to every IRQ
handled.
